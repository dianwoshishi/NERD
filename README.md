# NERD - Network Entity Reputation Database

NERD is a software and a service which acquires, stores and aggregates various data about known malicious network entities (mostly IP addresses) and provides them in a comprehensible way to users.

The main NERD instance runs at [nerd.cesnet.cz](https://nerd.cesnet.cz/).

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/CESNET/NERD/wiki) for more information.

## Docker supported

So far, I've now finished getting this project supported by Docker.

there are some changes:

- add Dockerfile to the root

- download `systemctl.py` from https://github.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement

- add `cp_systemctl` function in install script `common.sh` and use it multi-place, for copy systemctl.py "After "yum install" and before the next "systemctl" execution."
  
  the reason for that is ref: can not start the service when reboot? gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement#137 (comment)

## on your host
docker build -t nerd -f ./Dockerfile .
docker run -it -d --privileged  --name nerd nerd /usr/bin/systemctl
docker exec -it nerd /bin/bash
## in the container, /tmp/nerd_install/
./install/install_centos7.sh 

## now you can commit your container to a image. 
docker commit -a "dianwoshishi@sina.com" nerd nerd_v1.0
